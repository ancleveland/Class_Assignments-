1. Create a series containing the number of times each king was an attacker.

1. Create a series containing the number of times each king was a defender.

1. Combine these two variables into a single series. (Hint: How should you combine these two series? Can you add series in Pandas?)

1. Use your combined data to retrieve labels for your x-axis ticks.

1. Create a red bar chart and set its x-axis tick labels appropriately.

1. Add a title and labels to your plot.
